# C++ Matrix library
## Code Features:
- Generalised Inverse of m(rows) x n(columns) Matrix.
- Dynamic 1D & 2D array allocation to a variable.
- Generates random "mxn" matrix with double type in cell.
- Multiplication of 2 Matrices of sizes n x m & m x p.
- Transpose of Matrix.
- Inverse of nxn Matrix.
- Determinant of Matrix.
---
## Upcoming Features  
- Square root of Matrix.
- randomize the value in matrix cells properly
- rank of Matrix.
- Few decompositions such as QR, schur.
---
## How to use Code
- Use `main.cpp` to use existing data, refer to `Memory.h`, function input & return variable.
- Include respective header files in src folder to use the features in code.
---
## Code status
- Partly optimised.
- Not a clean code.
- Open to suggestions, issues.
---
## Validations
- Functions written in C are written as functions in matlab & mentioned in `Matlab` folder.
---
## References
- All the references mentioned in Research papers.
