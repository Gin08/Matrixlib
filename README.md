# Moore-Penrose-inverse of "mxn" Matrix
## Code Features:
- Generalised Inverse of m(rows) x n(columns) Matrix.
- Dynamic 1D & 2D array allocation to a variable.
- Multiplication of 2 Matrices of sizes n x m & m x p.
- Transpose of Matrix.
- Inverse of nxn Matrix.
- Determinant of Matrix.
---
## Upcoming Features
- Square root of Matrix.
- rank of Matrix.
---
## How to use Code
- Use `main.cpp` to compile existing data, properly refer to `Memory.h`, function input & return variable.
- Include `ginv.h` to use all the features in code.
---
## Code status
- Partly optimised.
- Not a clean code.
- Open to suggestions, issues.
